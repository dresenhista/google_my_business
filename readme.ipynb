    "# Pulling Review from Google My Business with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "After stumbling on a few scripts that did not work, I decided it was time to build my own. The context for this project is to pull all the reviews from Google My Business and then analyse which subjects people talk more about my business.\n",

    "## But First\n",
    "Before we start using the code you need to be allowed to use the API by Google.\n",
    "The process is basically:\n",
    "1. Create a project in the Google API Console, just like in here: https://developers.google.com/my-business/content/prereqs\n",
    "2. Apply for a access and wait, you do need to have an email from the business you are trying to get access. \n",
    "3. Then after you receive the email confirming, you need to extract the files as explained in the link https://developers.google.com/my-business/content/basic-setup\n",
    "\n",
    "I am also following the initial instructions provided in this link:\n",
    "https://developers.google.com/my-business/content/python\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have your token file plus the business information file let's pull the data. You will need to import the libraries below, so make sure you have them installed into Jupyter/Python.\n",
